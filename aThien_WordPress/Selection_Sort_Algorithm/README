Selection Sort Algorithm
Posted on November 9, 2019

Background: Selection Sort is the sorting algorithm which devides the given array into two parts.
Initially, the sorted part at the left end is empty and the unsorted part at the right end is the entire array.

This sorting algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and swapping it with the leftmost element of unsorted part.
After that, the minimum element is picked and moved to the sorted part.
